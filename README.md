# KOL-Trend

## Motivation
Do you feel lost in a sea of information when you are exploring social media, let's say, Reddit?
Key Opinion Leaders (KOL) are those who you may want to follow and check in. Those influencers will help you find out what the hottest topics are.
Not an Option for Reddit users!
Using batching Reddit's data, design an algorithm which can output the KOLâ€™s influences. The algorithm is to find out who are the KOLs, and then their rankings will be listed by searching results.
