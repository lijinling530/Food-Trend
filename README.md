# KOL-Trend

## Motivation
-Do you feel lost in a sea of information when you are exploring social media, let's say, Reddit?

-Key Opinion Leaders (KOL) are those who you may want to follow and check in. Those influencers will help you find out what the hottest topics are.

-Not an Option for Reddit users!

-Using batching Reddit's data, design an algorithm which can output the KOLâ€™s influences.

-The algorithm is to find out who are the KOLs, and then their rankings will be listed by searching results.
