# KOL-Trend
-Do you feel lost in huge amount of information when you want to make a simple choice, i.e., order food in a restaurant? 

-Key Opinion Leaders (KOL) are those who you may want to follow and check in. Those influencers will help you find out which restaurant is the one that best fits for you.

-KOLs made critical/accurate reviews and ratings which are more useful for users to consider.

-Not an Option for Reddit users!

-Using batching Reddit's comment data, design an algorithm which can output the KOLâ€™s influences.

-The algorithm is to find out who are the KOLs, and then their rankings will be listed by searching results.
